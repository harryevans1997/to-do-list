## toDoList

This repo is my first attempt at making a to-do list. The current aim of this project is to create react components that can fulfill the expected behaviour of a to-do list, such as adding or removing a list item from the to-do list.

I chose to use [**React**](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) for this project because it is a widely used library in the industry for making SPAs (single-page applications).
